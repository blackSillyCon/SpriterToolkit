#SpriterToolkit

JavaFX application that allows to export spritesheets in XML, JSON or plain text as well as exporting the sprites as separate files.

Be aware that mapping spritesheets larger than 512x512 will take significantly more time if the "merge distance" parameter is small. You might have to experiment different values to get the mapping right. This performance issue will hopefully be addressed in the future.
